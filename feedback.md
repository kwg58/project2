# Project 2 Evaluation
[inline code comments]()
## Technical Requirements
**2: Performing**
>The app contains 2 models, with at least 1 association. At least 1 model is full CRUD.

Giving you a "Performing" here because you went beyond the call of duty and implemented a many-to-many relationship. Per the technical requirements, however, I would have liked to see full CRUD functionality one at least one model. I know being able to update/delete actor/episode information wouldn't make much sense, but perhaps there's a creative way to implement that here (e.g., user comments on actors or episodes).

## Creativity and Interface
**2: Performing**
>The app displays a personal spin or creative element through its written language, functionality, purpose, and/or CSS. Submission includes proof of HTML / CSS validation

Very fun theme. I've always been meaning to get into M.A.S.H. - I'll prepare myself by doing some research with this.

## Code Quality
**2: Performing**
>Code is well-formatted, well-named, and contains few style / quality issues

Good job here. Had no problem reading and understanding your code.

Moving forward, don't work on a forked version of a project repo. Instead, just create your own from scratch. That makes forking and file navigation for us much easier.

## Deployment and Functionality
**0: Incomplete**
>Application is not deployed, and contains minimal functionality

I don't see a link to your deployed site. If it's deployed send it over and I'll update this feedback.

## Planning / Process / Submission
**2: Performing**
>Submission contains clear evidence of planning, adequate documentation, include all from previous category, as well as additional information such as unsolved issues.

Good job with your planning docs and readme. Consider putting some installation instructions in there for people who don't know how to get a Rails app up and running.

I would recommend placing your readme in the root directory of your app so that when somebody visits your repo that's the first thing they see.
